# HTML Project Template

Use the template using on Mac/Linux:

```git archive --remote=https://github.com/stho32/ProjectTemplate-HTML.git @ | tar -t```

You'll get a plain project structure with a basic index.html
empty files for css and js and a version of jquery and knockout.
The rest is up to you.
